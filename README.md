File-Renamer
============

A tool for assisting in renaming files under a root directory.

Written in C#, this is a small tool that makes renaming a large number of files hopefully easier. After giving it a root folder, it will loop through all the directories within that root and find all the files within those folders (including the root.) It will then, one-by-one, give the user the option to rename each file. It shows the current directory, file name, and extension. You can choose to keep the file name, or change it. You CANNOT change the extension, at least at this time.
